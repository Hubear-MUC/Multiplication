Multiplication 4.0
------------------

Two numbers get multiplied together.

With version 4.0 the program comes with full user interaction so running it with a debugger is not necessary anymore.

Just invoke the program after compilation.

The program first asks you for the first number of the multiplication, then for the second, each time showing a prompt like this:

  in : 
  
After entering the two numbers the program shows the result on the screen by an output- prompt like this:

  out :
