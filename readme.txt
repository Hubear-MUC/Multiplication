Multiplication 1.0
------------------

Two numbers get multiplied together.

The program has to be used with a debugger.

  1 int a,b,c;
  2
  3 main()
  4 {
  5 c=a*b;
  6 }

First set a breakpoint at line 4 to make the program stop before the 
calculation and enable you to enter the numbers for the calculation.

Then set a breakpoint at line 6 to make the program stop there for regarding
the result in variable c.

Then set the variables a and b to the numbers you want to multiply.

Now continue the program to do the calculation.

Next regard the content of variable c which will be the result.

Continue the program furthermore to let it finish.
