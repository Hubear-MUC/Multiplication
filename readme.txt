Multiplication 2.0
------------------

Two numbers get multiplied together.

The program has to be used with a debugger.

For the usage of your debugger please refer to the manual delivered with your
debugger.

  1 float a,b,c;
  2
  3 main()
  4 {
  5 c=a*b;
  6 }

First set a breakpoint at line 4 to make the program stop before the 
calculation and enable you to enter the numbers for the calculation.

Then set a breakpoint at line 6 to make the program stop there for regarding
the result in variable c.

Start the program execution.

Then set the variables a and b to the numbers you want to multiply.

Now continue the program to do the calculation.

Next regard the content of variable c which will be the result.

Continue the program furthermore to let it finish.

Take care to use the dot (.) for the separation between the integer- digits
and the fraction- digits. The comma (,) will not work.



Changes:
--------

Version 2.0:

Changed the data type of the numbers to float so that fraction- numbers can be
used for the calculation.
